In my 2nd year at Queenâ€™s, our Numerical Methods course further developed my previous experience using Matlab through bi-weekly labs. Each lab provided a unique challenge and each student was tasked with designing various algorithms to solve the problems given. Some of the numerical methods we studied and implemented were: Gaussian Elimination, bisection and golden section search, a 4th order Runge-Kutta differential equation solver, and the famous Lorenz equations. The following labs listed include the original lab sheet given to us, all Matlab code in a .zip file, and the final solution in .pdf format.
