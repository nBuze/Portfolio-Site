<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Designed from the beginning to showcase my skills and projects in an creative fashion, this website also demostrates the web development skills
    I learned to build this website. After becoming inspired by a variety of creative portfolio sites, I decided to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
    create my static site. This project is hosted by GitHub Pages and uses Jekyll to replicate modular elements of this website such as individual project
    pages. </p>
