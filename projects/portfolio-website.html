<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Designed from the beginning to showcase my skills and projects in an creative fashion, this website also demostrates the web development skills
    I learned to build this website. After becoming inspired by a variety of creative, online portfolios, I decided to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
    create a static website. This project is hosted by GitHub Pages and uses Jekyll to replicate modular elements of this website such as individual project
    pages. </p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The layout of the website was to be a simple one-page look to demonstrate my personal brand. Using a preliminary sketch, I developed the navigation, about section, project gallery, and contact info section. And although my paper sketch was what I wanted to see, I had a hard time creating a landing page I was thrilled about. There were several reasons behind this but to summarize, here are a few problems I ran into:</p>

<p class=center>1. Too many fonts, and too many colours. </p>

<p>The appearance of my website was not visually appealing, simply because there were too many fonts and colours. So, in August 2017, I did a full visual redesign and decided to go use three colours: Dark blue, a much lighter blue, and white. This created an overall theme and it ties my website together nicely. Similarly, I chose two main fonts – one for the headings and one for the paragraphs.</p>

<p class="center">2. My website was responsive but not mobile or tablet friendly.</p>

<p>This was a massive problem I ran into. By making my website responsive, I made it resizable with the browser window, but I had overlooked mobile compatibility. Starting in 2016, more consumers use mobile devices to browse the internet than a computer. To fix this problem, I used media queries which allows certain CSS properties to take effect at specific device widths. Using media queries allowed me to display the same website in a different format for a tablet and in a different format for mobile phones. Specifically, the menu at the top of the page transforms into a “hamburger” menu as the webpage gets resized. As well, fonts get smaller, and smaller size images are used instead for faster loading times.</p>

<p class="center">3. Project pages needed to share a common theme while displaying different content.</p>

<p>Using Jekyll, I created a project.html page to act as a layout for all my present and future project pages. The fonts and styles are the exact same across pages. I used a modular approach because it made it very easy to add new projects to my gallery and setup an individual project page. I can simply add text and a few photos, and I do not need to worry about HTML or CSS styling. Lastly, if I want to make a change to the font for all my project pages, I only need to edit one file, save it, and then the changes can be seen on all pages.</p>
