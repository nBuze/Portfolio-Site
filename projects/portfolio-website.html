<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Designed from the beginning to showcase my skills and projects in an creative fashion, this website also demostrates the web development skills
    I learned to build this website. After becoming inspired by a variety of creative, online portfolios, I decided to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
    create a static website. This project is hosted by GitHub Pages and uses Jekyll to replicate modular elements of this website such as individual project
    pages. </p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The layout of the website was to be a simple one-page look to demonstrate my personal brand. Using a preliminary sketch, I developed the navigation, about section, project gallery, and contact info section. And although my paper sketch was what I wanted to see, I had a hard time creating a landing page I was thrilled about. There were several reasons behind this but to summarize, here are a few problems I ran into:</p>

<p class=center>1. Too many fonts, and too many colours. </p>

<p>The appearance of my website was not visually appealing, simply because there were too many fonts and colours. So, in August 2017, I did a full visual redesign and decided to go use three colours: Dark blue, a much lighter blue, and white. This created an overall theme and it ties my website together nicely. Similarly, I chose two main fonts – one for the headings and one for the paragraphs.</p>

<p class="center">2. My website was responsive but not mobile/ tablet friendly.</p>

<p>This was a massive problem I ran into. By making my website responsive, I made it resizable with the browser window but I had overlooked mobile compatibility. Starting in 2016, more consumers use mobile devices to browse the internet than a computer. To fix this problem, I used media queries which allows certain css properties to take effect at specific device widths. Using media queries allowed me to display the same website in a different format for a tablet and in a different format for mobile phones. Specifically, the menu at the top of the page transforms into a “hamburger” menu as the webpage gets resized. As well, fonts get smaller, and smaller size images are used instead for faster loading times.</p>
