Designed from the beginning to showcase my skills and projects in an creative fashion, this website also showcases my web development skills used to build this website. After becoming inspired by a variety of creative portfolio sites, I decided to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create my static site. This project is hosted by GitHub Pages and uses Jekyll to replicate modular elements of this website such as individual project pages.
