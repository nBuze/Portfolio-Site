<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Spackler guitar pedal is a mid-range volume boost with the goal of adding "warmth" or "depth" to a guitar signal. It is not my original design, but I chose to build it to learn the fundamentals of PCB design using EagleCAD and improve my soldering and wiring of electronics.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The first step to manufacturing any PCB is the design. Using EagleCAD, I put together a schematic of the circuit which involves ¼W resistors, 16V capacitors, an LF442 IC, and a potentiometer to control volume gain. The LF442 is a low power input op amp which provides feedback to the circuit at several stages. Using pins, I was able to connect several nodes together that were physically far away, keeping the schematic clean and organized.</p>

<h2>Next steps for this project:</h2>
<p>• Recieve the PCBs in the mail.</p>
<p>• Set up the Spackler circuit on a breadboard and test to ensure all the components are working</p>
<p>• Add, solder, and then wire the necessary components onto the PCB</p>
<p>• Design the enclosure.</p>
<p>• Fabricate the enclosure out of wood, using the ShopBot machine.</p>
